Master  : give me a code to reverse an array in java
AI-ChatBot  : Here is a simple Java code to reverse an array:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        reverseArray(array);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(array));
    }
    public static void reverseArray(int[] arr) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;
        while (start < end) {
            int temp = arr[start];
            arr[start] = arr[end];
            arr[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses a two-pointer approach, where one pointer starts at the beginning of the array and the other pointer starts at the end of the array. It then swaps the elements at these two positions and moves the pointers towards each other until they meet in the middle.
Master  : give me a code to reverse an array in kotlin
AI-ChatBot  : Here is a simple Kotlin code to reverse an array:
```kotlin
fun main() {

}
```
In Kotlin, you can use the `reverse()` function to reverse an array. This function reverses the order of elements in the array in-place, meaning it modifies the original array.
